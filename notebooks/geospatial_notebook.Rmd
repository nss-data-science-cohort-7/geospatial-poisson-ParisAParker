This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
```
Reading in files
```{r}
burglaries <- read_csv("../data/burglaries_2023.csv")
census <- read_csv("../data/census.csv")
dc <- read_sf("../data/DC/DC.shp")
```
```{r}

burglaries_geo <- st_as_sf(burglaries |> drop_na(latitude),
coords = c('longitude','latitude'),
crs = st_crs(dc))
```
Perform a spatial join
```{r}
burglaries_join <- st_join(burglaries_geo, dc, join = st_within)
```

Looking at dataframe
```{r}
head(burglaries_join)
```

```{r}
census |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = burglaries_join, size = 01)
```

Removing an outlier from the data
```{r}
burglaries <- burglaries |>
  filter(latitude > 36)
```

```{r}

burglaries_geo <- st_as_sf(burglaries |> drop_na(latitude),
coords = c('longitude','latitude'),
crs = st_crs(dc))
```

```{r}
burglaries_join <- st_join(burglaries_geo, dc, join = st_within)
```

```{r}
census |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = burglaries_join, size = 01)
```
#Data looks much better

```{r}
burglaries_final <- left_join(burglaries_join, census, join_by(TRACTCE == tract))
```

```{r}
head(burglaries_final, 10)
```
Which census had the most burglaries?
```{r}
burglaries_final |> 
  
  group_by(TRACTCE) |> 
  count() |>
  arrange(desc(n))

```
Which census had the most unique incidents?
```{r}
burglaries_final |>
  group_by(TRACTCE) |>
  distinct(incident_number) |>
  count() |>
  arrange(desc(n))
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
